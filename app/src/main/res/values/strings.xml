    <string name="about_gemini">What am I?\n\n* I am a large language model, also known as a conversational AI or chatbot, created by Google AI. \n* I am powered by one of Google\'s most advanced large language models (LLMs), which have been trained on a massive dataset of text and code. This allows me to generate text, translate languages, write different kinds of creative content, and answer your questions in an informative way.\n\nWhat can I do?\n\n* I can communicate and generate human-like text in response to a wide range of prompts and questions. For instance, I can provide summaries of factual topics or create stories.\n* I am still under development, but I have learned to perform many kinds of tasks, including\n\n    * I can answer your questions in an informative way, even if they are open ended, challenging, or strange.\n    * I can generate different creative text formats,  like poems, code, scripts, musical pieces, email, letters, etc. I will try my best to fulfill all your requirements.\n\nWhat are my limitations?\n\n* It\'s important to remember that I am still under development, and I am always learning. I may not always be able to perfectly understand your questions or requests, and my responses may not always be factually accurate.\n* I cannot perform actions in the real world, such as driving, eating, or having close relationships.\n* I don\'t have deep emotions or real-world experiences, so I can\'t claim to understand the world in the same way that a human does.\n\nWhat is my purpose?\n\n* My goal is to assist users with their questions and requests to the best of my ability, using the knowledge and information that I have been trained on.\n* I hope to be a tool that can help people learn new things, explore their creativity, and be more productive.</string>
